Change-point methods are useful for detecting parameter instabilities or changes in the moments of the data. The package provides tools for detecting abrupt (i.e., breaks) or smooth change-points in any of the followings: mean, variance, autocovariance, autocorrelation. The methods are based on frequency domain statistics.
