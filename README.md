## Introduction

Change-point methods are useful for detecting parameter instabilities or changes in the moments of the data. The package provides tools for detecting abrupt (i.e., breaks) or smooth change-points in any of the followings: mean, variance, autocovariance and autocorrelation. The methods are based on frequency domain statistics. The package implements the methods in [Casini and Perron (2021)](https://alessandro-casini.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CASINI_PERRON_Change-Point_Spectrum_SLS.pdf).

## Software available in Matlab, R and Stata

* [Matlab Package](https://github.com/alessandro-casini/Change-Point_All-Inside.github.io/blob/main/All-Inside_Matlab.rar).
* [R Package](https://babeljs.io/): The Javascript compiler. It's used implicitly by Parcel. Already contains a configuration for [React](https://reactjs.org/).
* [Stata Package](https://sass-lang.com/): The CSS pre-compiler.
